    "text": "Development process\n\nIn this game jam, we were given the theme “Catalan folklore and legends”. We decided that creating a boss rush game, where each boss was based on a character from Catalan folklore, was the best idea. For the mechanics, we took inspiration from the game Slay the Spire and started developing our concept.\nWe also decided to try something new by using Godot as our game engine. Its system of nodes, nesting, and inheritance reminded us of object-oriented programming, which was really interesting to explore.\nThe coding was handled by Lluc, Nataly, and me, while David focused on sprites and visuals, and Andreu worked on the game’s music and sound effects. Even though we only managed to complete a small demo, we’re motivated to keep developing the project and aim for a more polished final design."

During the event’s presentation, a foreign participant asked the organizers if they could switch languages for their ease of understanding.\nOnce the presentation finished, we thought that it was a problem that someone couldn’t understand the language, so we decided to develop a tool that could help solve the problem. We decided to do it in Python, a language that we hadn’t really used but that was simple enough to not be a barrier.\nTwenty-four hours later, we had developed a pip library that translated code into other languages. Even though it was slow and not very complex, it helped us win the Rookies Award, a prize to the best first-year participants in the event."

Along the way, we learned about Docker, Python’s framework Django, RDFa, and several other aspects of web development—all while enjoying the game aspect of the web."

Then we implemented the asteroid rain which gave the player the option to throw the mineral upwards against the asteroid to defend the planet from destruction.\nThanks to the team’s work combined and the masterclass given to us by Brián Piancino we were able to develop the game and win the event’s first prize."

It then returned a pseudo-presentation that updated dynamically with each vote.\nThis project was both a way to explore new tools and an opportunity to overcome personal challenges, as we learned to work with FastAPI and noSQL databases."
