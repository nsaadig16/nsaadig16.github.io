## Description

**Translator UABTheHack** is a `pip` library developed in the University of Barcelona's (UAB) first hackathon, *UABTheHack*. It contains a method called 
`translate_code()` that takes a file and translates it to another language using the Google Translate API.

## Development process

<p align="justify">
This was the first hackathon I attended, knowing just a few things about basic programming. During the event's presentation, a foreign participant asked
the organizers if they could switch languages for their ease of understanding. 

Once the presentation finished, we thought that it was a problem that someone
couldn't understand the language, so we decided to develop a tool that could help solve the problem. We decided to do it in Python, a language that we hadn't
really used but that was simple enough to not be a barrier. 

Twenty-four hours later, we had developed a `pip` library that translated code into other languages.
Even though it was slow and not very complex, it helped us win the **Rookies Award**, a prize to the best first-year participants in the event.
