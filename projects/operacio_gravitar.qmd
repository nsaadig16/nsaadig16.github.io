## Description

**Operació: Gravitar** is a game created at the *Lleida's 2024 Lan Party Game Jam*. It presents Nil, an astronaut who has been sent on a mission to
collect precious mineral from the pletorian moon while trying to avoid the imminent asteroid rain.

## Development process

<p align="justify">
This was my first game jam, where we were given the theme "Out of orbit". After some hours of brainstorming, we came up with
the idea of having the player orbit around the planet. 

We also wanted to implement some sort of "resource management", so we decided
that the player should collect pieces of mineral and bring them to the factory. Then we implemented the asteroid rain which gave the
player the option to throw the mineral upwards against the asteroid to defend the planet from destruction. 

Thanks to the team's work combined and the masterclass given to us by [Brián Piancino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-piancino/) we were able to develop the
game and win the event's first prize.
