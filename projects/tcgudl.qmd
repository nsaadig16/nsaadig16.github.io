## Description

**TCGUdL** is a web application developed in Django that replicates a trading card game style. Created as a project for our "Web Project" 
class, it contains UdL professors as characters in the cards.

## Development process

<p align="justify">
Our team, composed mainly of second-year students enrolled in a third-year class, was given the task of developing a web app that met a series of requirements but could follow any theme we wanted. We decided to take this project head-on and replicate the pack-opening and collection aspects of a typical trading card game. Along the way, we learned about Docker, Python’s framework Django, RDFa, and several other aspects of web development—all while enjoying the game aspect of the web.
