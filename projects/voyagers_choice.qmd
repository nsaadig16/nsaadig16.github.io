## Description

**Voyager's choice** is a website used to plan a trip with your friends. You and your trip companions will join a room,
where a slideshow of travel destinations will show up. Everyone can vote on it and take part in the final decision.

## Development process

<p align="justify">
At *HackUPC 2025*, we developed a website for the SkyScanner challenge called "Voyager's Choice." 
I worked on the backend alongside Lluc Vivet, using Gemini's API to process the data and SQLite as our database.

The structure was quite simple: the frontend collected a form with the user’s trip preferences, 
and the backend processed it with Gemini and the flight database provided by SkyScanner. 
It then returned a pseudo-presentation that updated dynamically with each vote.

This project was both a way to explore new tools and an opportunity to overcome personal challenges, as 
we learned to work with **FastAPI** and **noSQL** databases.</p>
