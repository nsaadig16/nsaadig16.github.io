## Description

**Cartes del mite** is a game created at the *Lleida's 2025 Lan Party Game Jam*. The game revolves around combined
RPG and card mechanics, inspired by the game *Slay the Spire*, and themed around Catalan legends and folklore.

## Development process

<p align="justify">
In this game jam, we were given the theme **"Catalan folklore and legends"**. We decided that creating a *boss rush* game,
where each boss was based on a character from Catalan folklore, was the best idea. For the mechanics,
 we took inspiration from the game *Slay the Spire* and started developing our concept.

We also decided to try something new by using **Godot** as our game engine. Its system of nodes, 
nesting, and inheritance reminded us of object-oriented programming, which was really interesting to explore.

The coding was handled by Lluc, Nataly, and me, while David focused on sprites and visuals, 
and Andreu worked on the game's music and sound effects. Even though we only managed 
to complete a small demo, we’re motivated to keep developing the project and aim for a more polished final design.
