Hi! My name is **Naïm Saadi Gallego**.

I'm an undergrad Computer Science student at University of Lleida (UdL). I'm passionate
about technology and continuous learning. Over the past two years, I actively participated in 
hackathons and gamejams, which have sharpened my problem-solving skills, strengthened my teamwork abilities and improved my knowledge as a future engineer.

I'm eager to keep growing as a developer by taking on new challenges and applying my skills to real-world projects.
You can reach me at [nsaadig16@gmail.com](mailto:nsaadig16@gmail.com)
